# Crossword-Puzzle-Maker
A crossword puzzle generator that creates valid crossword puzzle configurations from the command line. Java program using English language dictionary as word source. 

I first create a random grid with a fixed number of continuous white spaces. Then I find every place in the puzzle where there could be a start of a word. Then the puzzle is filled in starting from longest word to shortest word. Then the puzzle is displayed on the screen, and the solution to the puzzle is printed out in the console. 

I worked on this project at the end of 2014 as a side project for fun.
